												<h3>▶ Point Breakdown</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b>1. Sketching and planning the map layout.</b></p>
											<p>This map was a very interesting experiment for me, as it was the first Mann vs. Machine map I have made completely solo. This meant I had to learn Hammer, the map editor used in the Source Engine. This process went pretty quickly and it is now one of my favourite tools ever to use. I spent a good amount of time analyzing official Valve maps and community made maps to figure out what could be a cool and unique idea. Most maps have the robot spawn, two paths they can take and then the players' base where the robots have to deploy their bomb to win. I decided to try to give a twist to this concept by making two paths that merge at the middle of the map and then split again, making for a cool gameplay experience. I also wanted to heavily utilize flanking paths, side paths the robots can take to suprise players and add further variety when designing missions.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>2. Creating the entire map in the Hammer Map Editor.</b></p>
											<p>Moving onwards to making the actual map, one thing that became very apparent after blocking out the initial layout was that the map size was way way too big. I timed it using the fastest class in the game, the Scout and running back and forth and it revealed my map was much much longer. So, the map would recieve two major cuts during the creation process. I would also eliminate a lot of empty space. I then began setting up the map logic, which took quite a long time since this was all new to me but after a few days I was able to get it to official quality, logic-wise. Began running my own first private tests and things seemed to work fairly well. I then began with basic detailing and had my first proper playtest with others, which led to some minor gameplay changes based on excellent feedback. After that, it has been mainly detailing the map and preparing missions.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>3. Creating missions (via .pop files) to provide gameplay.</b></p>
											<p>Mission design was heavily augmented and shaped by gameplay I recycled some old missions I had abandoned and rewrote them for the map which was used as the main testing missions. I later would go on to craft a more unique missions specifically designed for the map. It was receieved well in the playtests and small adjustments were made following feedback.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>4. Organizing my own playtests to gather feedback for the map.</b></p>
											<p>I have held two major playtests so far and the feedback has been greatly used to improve gameplay of the map. I also test a lot on my own to get a basic idea of play. Some basic examples of feedback taken and applied is adding more ammo and health, improving cover and defensive positions across the entire map. Removing a lot of dead space to make combat against the robots more exciting.</p>
