										<p><b>About:</b> BEETLEBOT is a singleplayer third person shooter in which the player takes control of a mechanical beetle built to exterminate ants. Starting from top of the anthill and descending down the colony, it will kill every ant in sight, with the end goal of killing the Ant Queen.</p>

												<h3>▶ Contribution Breakdown</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b>1. Researched and sketched level designs and concepts based on ant colonies.</b></p>
											<p>The level design process for BEETLEBOT was done with two other designers and the idea was to get as many ideas, concepts and blockouts done as possible while the programmers were busy building the base of the game. It was done in a in-house engine so remote sharing wasn't possible. I began to personally look into ant colony diagrams and layouts and got a few ideas of that, especially with our gameplay in mind. I would come up with a few dozen concepts, some favouring gameplay more than the realism of ant architecture mainly because a lot of ant colonies are built in a very similar way.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>2. Designed and gave feedback on other level sections designed.</b></p>
											<p>TBD</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>3. Refined difficulty and overall balance in the game.</b></p>
											<p>TBD</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>4. Helped implement and tune screen shake in several aspects.</b></p>
											<p>TBD</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>5. Assisting with sound design by finding, implementing and tweaking volumes of certain sound effects.</b></p>
											<p>TBD</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>6. Playtesting to report critical issues and flaws.</b></p>
											<p>Playtesting was something the entire team did consistently. During the final few days, I started to playtest very often and was usually the guinea pig for any new changes/fixes the programmers rolled out. Reported several crashes especially during the level loading process, which were fixed in the last few hours of the project. It also led to me myself adjusting spawn and teleport points in the levels to fix some issues as well.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>7. Wrote the credits.</b></p>
											<p>I recieved the task during the final week of development to gather the contributions of everyone and write the credits, which was then sent to fellow artist Fanny who would turn into proper looking credits. The process went smoothly, but I made sure to review constantly with the team to make sure no one felt under represented in the credits. I also took some time to threw in a few inside joke credits as well. All in good fun! I am very satisfied with the end product.</p>
